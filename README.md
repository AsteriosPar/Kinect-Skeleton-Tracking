# KINECT SKELETON TRACKING
The project is based on the Kinect Sensor V2 and can extract comprehensive joints information from all parts of the body. Human body posture can be detected, while demonstrating the wide range of parameters that can be extracted. This project can be further extended to be used for continuous full body gait tracking.
